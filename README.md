# PixelCNN
Implementation of Gated and Non-Gated version of PixelCNN as proposed in  [Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328). This kind of an architecture is used for conditional image generation. The CNN proposed takes care of the blindspots of PixelCNN presented originally in [Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759).

# Requirements
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Keras (optional if you have mnist reader separately)
